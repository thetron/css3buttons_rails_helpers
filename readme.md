# css3buttons

The __css3buttons__ gem is a small set of helper methods designed to work in
conjunction with the __amazing__ [css3 github buttons by Nicolas Gallagher](http://nicolasgallagher.com/lab/css3-github-buttons/).

The helpers allow rails developers to quickly and easily leverage this
fantastic CSS library - without cluttering up your views and calls to
`link_to`, `button_to` and `submit_tag`.

# Version 1.0 is finally here!

And with it brings support for the Rails 3.1 asset pipeline. __Please note:__ as of version 1.0.0, Rails 3.0.x is no longer supported. If you're wanting to use the css3buttons on a Rails 3.0.x project, please install version 0.9.5 (see below for full instructions).

# Getting started - Rails 3.1

Include the gem in your gemfile and run `bundle install`

    gem 'css3buttons'

Require the stylesheets in `app/assets/stylesheets/application.css`:

	*= require css3buttons
	*= require_self
	...
	
By default, css3buttons comes with a reset stylesheet built in. Because of this, you should load it before any other stylesheets. However, if you don't want to use reset, or already have your own, just require this instead:

	*= require css3buttons/without-reset
	*= require_self
	...

# Getting started - Rails 3.0.x

Include the gem in your gemfile and run 'bundle install`

    gem 'css3buttons', '0.9.5'

Run the generators:

    $ rails g css3buttons

Which will copy the stylesheets and icon/button images into your public
directory.

In your layout, add the following:

    <%= css3buttons_stylesheets %>

Which will add both the `reset.css` and the `css3buttons.css` stylesheet
link tags. 

By default, css3buttons comes with a reset stylesheet built in. Because of this, you should load it before any other stylesheets. However, if you'd like to use your own reset, you can skip it with:

    <%= css3buttons_stylesheets :include_reset => false %>


# The basics

To change your `link_to` calls to buttons, simply use `button_link_to`.
For example:

    <%= button_link_to "Search", search_path %>

The helper methods accept all the same parameters as `link_to` so
upgrading and downgrading to css3buttons should be a snap.


# Icons and pills and colours, oh my!

The gem also responds to a huge list of dynamic helper methods, to assist in adding
icons, colours and styles to your buttons. Unlike previous versions of
the gem, you can now add any of the features in any order.


## Icons

To add an icon from [the current icon list](http://nicolasgallagher.com/lab/css3-github-buttons/), simply prepend the helper method with the name of the icon you'd like to use. For example:

    <%= magnifier_button_link_to "Search", search_path %>
    <%= user_button_link_to "Account", edit_current_user_path %>
    <%= pin_button_link_to "Mark on map", edit_map_path %>


## Styles

Just like the icons, you can add options for `primary`, `big` and
`pill`.

    <%= primary_button_link_to "Home", root_path %>
    <%= pill_button_link_to "Archive", archive_path %>
    <%= big_primary_pill_button_link_to "Super Important!", super_important_path %>


## Colors

Again with colors - simply add `positive` or `negative` to the front of your method call:

    <%= negative_trash_button_link_to "Delete", delete_path %>
    <%= positive_pill_reload_button_link_to "Reload", reload_path %>

In order to be compatible with the new css3 github buttons library, you can also use `danger` and `safe` - as alternatives.


## Button groups

Button groups are snap, you just need to wrap your buttons with `button_group`, like so:

    <%= button_group do %>
      <%= button_link_to "Show", @post %>
      <%= button_link_to "Edit", edit_post_path(@post) %>
      <%= negative_trash_button_link_to "Delete", @post, :confirm => "Are you sure? %>
    <% end %>

And, of course, minor groups:

    <%= minor_button_group do %>
      You know the drill by now.
    <% end %>


## Split Buttons (Button groups)

Split Buttons (no javascript!), similar to Button Groups, are extremely easy to create by using a `split_button_group`, like so:
  
    <%= split_button_group do %>
      <%= primary_add_button_link_to "New Post", @post %>
      <%= button_link_to "Edit", edit_post_path(@post) %>
      <%= negative_trash_button_link_to "Delete", @post, :confirm => "Are you sure? %>
    <% end %>

Pill Split Buttons are also easy to do:

    <%= pill_split_button_group do %>
      <%= primary_add_button_link_to "New Post", @post %>
      <%= button_link_to "Edit", edit_post_path(@post) %>
      <%= negative_trash_button_link_to "Delete", @post, :confirm => "Are you sure? %>
    <% end %>


## Submit tags, button tags and using icons on form buttons

Submit tags were ushered in with version 0.9.2. Everything works as it does above, except instead of `button_link_to` it's `button_submit_tag`. Example:

    <%= positive_button_submit_tag "Publish" %>

Keep in mind however, that icons do not work on `<submit>` tags. If you're wanting to include icons in your forms there is also a helper method to insert `<button>` tags instead. The method suffix in this case is `button_tag`. Examples:

    <%= approve_button_tag "Update profile" %>
    <%= negative_trash_button_tag "Deactivate account" %>


# Formtastic compatibility

If you're using
[formtastic](https://github.com/justinfrench/formtastic), you may
experience issues with using css3buttons in your forms, due to the
way the built-in formtastic styles modify default form buttons. In this
instance, you can insert the following into your
`formtastic_changes.css` stylesheet.

    form.formtastic input.button, form.formtastic.button.button {
      height: 25px;
      padding: 0.2em 1em 0.2em 2.5em;
      font-family: sans-serif;
      font-size: 11px;
      margin-left: 5px;
    }

# What's missing?

The `button_group` helper needs some proper tests, if anyone can point me as to how to stub out a rails request template in RSpec (or the right way to approach this test at all), that would be much appreciated!

I've noticed that this version of the css3 github buttons does not include any colours for the positive/safe styles - so this will appear as normal buttons, unless you add your own styling.

Forks and pull requests are always welcome.
